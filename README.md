Data-Visualization-Vasious-Libraries

In first project, Bokeh library has been used for data visualization.
In second project, with silly data I wanted to show how Networkx can be used to create graphs.

For data visualization with bokeh, dataset is the SF Property Crime data here: https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Monthly-Property-Crime-2005-to-2015/k5vw-3yuz
